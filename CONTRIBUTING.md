# How to Contribute

**Note**: We are not currently updating the code with contributions, partly because I do not have much time and I am not good at managing contributions.

However, if you do make a change and are burning to add it to Docs to Markdown, I will try to find the time to take a look at it. Even if we do not use your exact code, we will credit you as a contributor.

See [dev.md](dev.md) for development tips.
