# Not currently accepting contributions

If you do make a change and are burning to add it to Docs to Markdown, I will try to find the time to take a look at it. But I cannot guarantee that I will incorporate your pull request.

**Note**: If you do send a pull request, please make it small and focused.

See [dev.md](dev.md) for development tips.
